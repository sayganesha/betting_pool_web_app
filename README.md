====================

A flask web app that helps run a betting pool

What is this Webapp for ?
=========================
This is a simple webapp that was developed so that one can 
create a fun Betting pool (with virtual money ;) ).
The idea was to learn webapp development and develop a fun app.

The webapp was developed using Flask.
Flask is a micro webdevelopment framework for Python.
Since I think Python is a faily good programming language
masked as a scripting language, Flask looks like a good
candidate. (Another option I considered was Bottle).
