betting_pool_web_app
====================

A flask web app that helps run a betting pool

What is this Webapp for ?
=========================
This is a simple webapp that was developed so that one can 
create a fun Betting pool (with virtual money ;) ).
The idea was to learn webapp development and develop a fun app.

The webapp was developed using Flask.
Flask is a micro webdevelopment framework for Python.
Since I think Python is a faily good programming language
masked as a scripting language, Flask looks like a good
candidate. (Another option I considered was Bottle).

Pre-requisites
==============
Since this uses Flask web development toolkit, please
install Flask on your system.
(Find how to install it at : http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation )

Configuration Files
===================
Configure your application using the config file picked up
from the environment variable BETTING_APP_CFG_FILE .
The sample config file to use is config/settings.cfg
